Exposure to opioid analgesics due to surgery increases the risk of new persistent opioid use. A mechanistic hypothesis for opioids’ abuse liability rests on the belief that in addition to pain relief, acute opioid treatment improves mood, e.g. via euphoria and anxiety relief. However, opioids do not consistently improve mood in laboratory studies of healthy non-opioid users. In this study, we test how two commonly used opioid analgesics (remifentanil and oxycodone) affect patients’ subjective well-being in standard clinical practice. Day surgery patients rated their mood before and after open-label infusion of remifentanil (N=159) or oxycodone (N=110) on the operating table before general anesthesia.
